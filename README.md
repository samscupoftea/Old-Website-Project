NOTES FOR MY WEBSITE WILL GO HERE. TO BE UPDATED...

14th March: Today I started my webpage.
The first thing I did was consult the design notes that I had simply made on a paper notepad. I knew that my website needed certain criterea. So I decided to design it to have three seperate sections. 1. About me: Which would use 3 centered flex columns resembling cards with a picture and text. 2. Why Software Develpment section. This part would be structured differently, with the content stacked. But I wanted to have vert wide thin artwork that would act as line breaks for each important point. 3. My Project journey section. For this section, I would employ the skils i learnt from making project cards in both my Project gallery and movie data. This time I would like them to be include some JS interactivity as well.

I started by creating my website header and Nav bar.

As the header and nav bar sections would be very similar to that of my Movie data (in that the code was generally the same structure), this part wouldn't be too much of a challenge. But once I moved on to my "about me" section I had to really think about how I would design and code it. I didn't want to make cards like I had in previous projects as I plan to use that for the later project sections.
So I used a flext column system and used border, padding and color to turn them into neat boxes.
It took a lot of trial and error and consulting websites in order to find the right code for the job.

15th March:
Today was all about the about me section. I worked hard to get this part coded and styled in the way I liked. It has taken some time but I am now happy with the end result.

16th March:
Now that I have designed the first proper section of my website, it's time to move on to the second part. "Why Software Development". I actually got quite stuck figuring out how to differntiate each section so that the next content was place correctly below and seperate from the section before. What I realized was wrong was my <main> tags which needed to be fitted around my first section.
